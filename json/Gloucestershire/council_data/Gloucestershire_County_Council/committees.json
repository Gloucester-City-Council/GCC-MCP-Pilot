Certain kinds of decisions, for example, changing the council’s constitution or setting the rate of council tax can only be taken at meetings of the full Council. The full Council has such wide powers it would be impractical for it to make every decision itself. It therefore concerns itself with setting the broad policy and budgetary framework of the authority. More detailed decisions are made by what are known as “council bodies”, for example, the Planning Committee and by the Council’s Cabinet. Please contact Democratic Services on 01452 324204",

A sub-committee is then set up to consider the complaint. The Complaints Sub-Committee is made up of the lead members of the Panel as well as one of the available independent members. An agenda will be published 5 clear working days before the meeting and the items handling the complaint will be in exempt session. The Sub-Committee’s role is to facilitate informal resolution; this is about solving, explaining or clearing up, or settling a matter directly with the complainant without an investigation or formal proceedings.
