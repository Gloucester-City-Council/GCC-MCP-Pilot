Cabinet consists of the Leader of the Council and eight Councillors appointed by the Leader. When major decisions are to be discussed or made, these are published in the Cabinet\u0027s Forward Plan in so far as they can be anticipated. If these decisions are to be discussed with council officers at a meeting of the Cabinet, this will generally be open for the public to attend except where personal or confidential matters are being discussed. The Cabinet has to make decisions which are in line with the Council\u0027s overall policies and budget. If it wishes to make a decision which is outside the Budget or Policy Framework, this must be referred to the Council as a whole to decide. There are circumstances in which Cabinet Members may make individual executive decisions and these are set out in an advice note to members, together with the procedure to be followed. Public questions can be asked at meetings of the Cabinet provided that they meet the criteria and are received by 12 noon on the seventh working day before the day of the meeting. More information can be found on our public questions page.",

To comply with current best practice for audit committees, an Annual Report is produced to summarise the work undertaken by the committee during the previous municipal year and demonstrate that it has fulfilled its terms of reference. Sharing a summary of its activities and achievements serves as a useful reminder of the role of the committee in providing assurance about the council’s governance, risk management and financial and business controls.

At the time the Joint Overview and Scrutiny Review Panel was convened, Gloucestershire Airport was a jointly-owned asset of both Councils. In June 2025, both Councils approved a decision to sell Gloucestershire Airport to a recommended bidder. As a large local employer and contributor to the local economy, Overview and Scrutiny Committee Members have retained an interest in the current operations of Gloucestershire Airport, as well as the future of the organisation. The Joint Overview and Scrutiny Review Panel propose to meet on two occasions, initially to consider the latest financial and operational updates from the airport so that they can understand the position facing the potential new owner. Once the sale has taken place, a secondary session will be held to look ahead to the future of Gloucestershire Airport under its new ownership.",

                           "purpose":  "The Overview and Scrutiny Committee (O\u0026S) has statutory powers to scrutinise decisions the executive is planning to take, those it plans to implement, and those that have already been taken or implemented. O\u0026S can enable improvements to be made to policies or the implementation of those policies, and also has an important role to play in developing policy and improving performance. The Overview and Scrutiny Committee will: -Provide constructive ‘critical friend’ challenge to the executive; -Amplify the voices and concerns of the public; -Be led by independent people who take responsibility for their role; and -Drive improvement in public services in Cheltenham. If you would like to know more about how Overview and Scrutiny operates in the Borough you may find the set of scrutiny guidelines that have been developed useful. These are in the process of being updated. More information about what has been achieved through Overview and Scrutiny in recent years is contained in the Overview and Scrutiny Annual reports: 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 2023-24 2024-25 If you would like the Overview and Scrutiny Committee to set up a task group to look at a *particular issue then you can contact your Ward Councillor who can put forward the topic on your behalf. * Please note that there is a limit to the amount of task groups that can be in operation at any one time and it will be for the Overview and Scrutiny Committee to decide whether it can investigate the issues that you suggest. The Overview and Scrutiny Committee cannot deal with Planning or Licensing matters or complaints as there are other processes for dealing with them. Are you interested in a particular agenda item? Why not attend a meeting to find out more and see the Overview and Scrutiny Committee in action. Meeting dates/times (past, present and future) are advertised on our website, along with agendas and reports. Perhaps you are interested in a review that a Task Group is about to undertake and you would like to contribute your views on the matter. You can do this by contacting democratic services ( [email protected] ), however, it is best if you can provide these comments at an early stage of any review in order that the Task Group can consider them properly.",

These are usually high-profile cases which have generated public interest. The planning officers prepare a detailed report for each application considered by the committee. This report includes an assessment of the proposal, comments from consultees (such as the Environment Agency, the local Civic Society, and internal sources such as conservation and tree officers) and any written submissions sent by members of the public. The report ends with a recommendation to the members. Photographs and plans are available to assist committee members in their considerations. Council officers attend the meeting to advise members and to answer any questions arising from the debates. The committee can approve, refuse or (occasionally) defer an application. Decision notices are issued within two working days of the committee meeting via Public Access . We encourage public involvement in the planning process and members of the public have the opportunity to put their views on a planning proposal direct to the planning committee. The opportunity to speak at the planning committee is in addition to the statutory process of written submissions. One speaker in support and one in objection is allowed to speak, in addition to ward and parish councillors. For more information about speaking at planning committee please read our guide on having your say at planning committee .",
